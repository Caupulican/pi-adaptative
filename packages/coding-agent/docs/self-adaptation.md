# Self-Adaptation

Pi can turn something you just did into a durable, reusable capability. When a session reveals a repeatable workflow, Pi can draft a new **skill** or **extension** for it, check it for overlap with what you already have, validate it, and — once you approve — make it live the same turn. No restart, no hand-authoring boilerplate.

This keeps a human on the edge of the loop: Pi proposes, you confirm, then it activates.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/skillify` | Capture a repeatable workflow from the session and draft a new skill. |
| `/extensionify` | Scaffold a new extension (a tool or command) from the session. |
| `/learn` | Reflect on the session, classify the lesson, and route it to the right outcome. |

The same analysis is also available to the model as the `skillify`, `extensionify`, and `skill_audit` tools.

## How proposal and activation are separated

Authoring has a hard boundary between *drafting* and *committing*:

- **Proposal** is non-destructive. The `skillify` and `extensionify` tools analyze the session, generate a draft, validate it, and return it. They never write to disk and never reload anything, so they are safe for the model — or a subagent — to call.
- **Activation** is human-gated. The persistent write and the live reload happen only at the `/skillify` and `/extensionify` commands in your main session, and only after you confirm the draft.

Because activation lives only at the interactive layer, a subagent can at most produce a proposal — it can never persist or activate a capability on its own.

## Skillify

`/skillify` builds a [skill](skills.md) from what the session demonstrated:

1. It captures the repeatable process — goal, inputs, outputs, success criteria, and any corrections you made along the way.
2. It applies skill-authoring doctrine (a focused, one-job skill with clear frontmatter).
3. It drafts the `SKILL.md` and validates the name and description.
4. It runs [duplicate detection](#duplicate-detection) against your loaded skills.
5. It shows you the draft. On your confirmation, it writes the skill to `~/.pi/agent/skills/<name>/` and reloads it so `/skill:<name>` works immediately.

The doctrine skills it leans on (`skill-architect`, `pi-harness-learning`) ship with Pi as bundled skills, so skillify works out of the box. Like any bundled resource, they can be overridden by your own versions or filtered out with a [resource profile](resources.md).

## Extensionify

`/extensionify` scaffolds an [extension](extensions.md) — an `index.ts` factory that registers a tool or command, plus an optional `package.json` manifest.

Before anything is offered for activation, the candidate is **smoke-tested in isolation**: Pi runs the generated factory against a throwaway runtime, never the live one. If it throws, times out, or fails validation, the proposal comes back rejected with diagnostics, and activation refuses to write or load it. Only a clean isolated load — and your explicit confirmation — lets the real extension be written to `~/.pi/agent/extensions/<name>/` and loaded live.

## Learn

`/learn` is the broader post-session pass. It summarizes the durable lesson and classifies it: is this a memory, a refinement to an existing skill, a brand-new skill, a prompt, an extension, or nothing worth keeping? It then routes the lesson to the matching proposal — `skillify` or `extensionify`, a targeted edit, or a note — and surfaces the result for you to activate.

`/learn` orchestrates; it never writes or activates on its own. Long-term memory storage is handled outside Pi; `/learn` routes to it rather than implementing it.

## Duplicate detection

The `skill_audit` tool guards against accumulating near-identical skills. Given a draft's name, description, and body, it scans your loaded skills and scores keyword overlap. Matches above the similarity threshold are flagged so you can **merge or refine** an existing skill instead of adding a redundant one.

It runs entirely locally — no network call, no embedding model — so it is safe and instant. You can also call it on its own to audit an existing set of skills for overlap.

## Going live

Activation finishes by hot-reloading the new capability through the same live load/unload path the [Resources hub](resources.md#manage-library) uses. A skill or extension you just approved is usable the moment it is written — the ingest → author → live loop closes in a single turn.
